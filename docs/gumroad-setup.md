# Gumroad Listing Checklist

Use this guide to publish Songboard on Gumroad alongside the GitHub repo.

## 1. Create the product
1. Sign in to Gumroad and click **Products → New product**.
2. Choose **Digital product** and give it a name (e.g., “Songboard for macOS”).
3. Set the price to **$0+** so supporters can pay what they want.
4. Add a download file by URL and paste `https://github.com/willsigmon/songboard/releases/download/bundle/songboard-macos.zip`. This bundle is rebuilt automatically on every push to `main`.

## 2. Polish the page
- Cover image: reuse `docs/social-preview.png`.
- Description: copy the hero section from the README or tailor it for Gumroad.
- Call-to-action: highlight that the download includes the watcher script and installation guide.
- Add a short feature list plus tips for running the LaunchAgent.

## 3. Launch
1. Publish the product and copy the Gumroad link (e.g., `https://willsigmon.gumroad.com/l/songboard`).
2. Drop the link into the README tip jar or quick-start section.
3. Announce the Gumroad listing on socials along with the GitHub link so users can pick their preferred experience.
4. Optional: keep Gumroad’s default email notification enabled so fans hear about new features when you push to GitHub (they’ll always receive the up-to-date bundle).

Optional: enable Gumroad email notifications to keep supporters updated when you ship new features.
