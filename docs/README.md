## Docs & Assets

- `social-preview.png`: ready-to-upload 1280×640 GitHub social preview. Set it under **Repository → Settings → General → Social preview**.
- Drop any additional media (screen recordings, GIFs, etc.) in this folder so everything shareable lives together.

Nothing in here is required for the watcher to run; it just keeps repo visuals organized.
