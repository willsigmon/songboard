> Requires macOS with Python 3 (preinstalled on current macOS versions).

- Want a direct zip? Always up-to-date download: [songboard-macos.zip](https://github.com/willsigmon/songboard/releases/download/bundle/songboard-macos.zip).

```bash
# 1. Drop the watcher script on your machine
mkdir -p ~/Scripts
curl -o ~/Scripts/songlink_clipboard_watcher.py https://raw.githubusercontent.com/willsigmon/songboard/main/songlink_clipboard_watcher.py
chmod +x ~/Scripts/songlink_clipboard_watcher.py

# 2. Install a LaunchAgent so it auto-starts on login
mkdir -p ~/Library/LaunchAgents
cat > ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.songlink.clipboard.plist <<'EOF'
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">

## üß† macOS tips
- On first launch, macOS may prompt you to allow `/usr/bin/python3` (Songboard) under **System Settings ‚Üí Privacy & Security ‚Üí Accessibility**. Approve it to enable instant Command+C triggers; decline and Songboard simply falls back to gentle polling.
- Pause Songboard dynamically with `launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.songlink.clipboard.plist`; reload when you want it back.
- Extend coverage by adding hosts to `SONG_HOSTS`, `SONG_HOST_PREFIXES`, or `SONG_HOST_SUFFIXES` inside `songlink_clipboard_watcher.py`.
- Need insight? Tail `/tmp/songlink.err` while you iterate.

---

## üí° Behind the scenes
- Polls the clipboard every 200‚ÄØms using `pbpaste`/`pbcopy`
- Guards against double-processing so you don‚Äôt lose the original link
- Retries gracefully if macOS rejects a clipboard write
- Lives in [`songlink_clipboard_watcher.py`](songlink_clipboard_watcher.py) (‚âà120 lines)

Peek at the full walkthrough in [`songlink-setup.md`](songlink-setup.md) for extra installation context and uninstall instructions.

## üì∏ Share-ready assets
- Upload `docs/social-preview.png` as the GitHub social preview (Settings ‚Üí General ‚Üí Social preview) and bring the same image to your social launch.
- Suggested caption: *Songboard instantly turns every music link I copy into a universal Song.link page. One copy, every streaming service. https://github.com/willsigmon/songboard*
- Demonstration clips or GIFs live well inside `docs/`‚Äîlink them from the README or your announcement post.
